# Winder

A small app to show me the wind status on my favourite kite spots. It uses the [SMHI api](https://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
